This code is to be used when attempting to dollar cost average over a longer period of time (3+ months)

If you insert the yields of bonds into the program, it will tell you which ones to buy and how much.
This will help increase your ROI because it prevents the excess cash from sitting around and doing nothing while dollar cost averaging

Run main.java to activate program.
